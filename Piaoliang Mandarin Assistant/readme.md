Piaoliang Manadarin Chinese Vocabulary Assistant. Intended for use with Integrated Chinese 4E (Cheng & Tsui).\
REQUIRES JDK 23 OR LATER\
I started this program during my MCHI200 class at Concordia University because I was tired of lugging around my flash cards.\

One day I'll probably turn it into a mobile app, we'll see.

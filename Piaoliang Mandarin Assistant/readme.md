Piaoliang Manadarin Chinese Vocabulary Assistant. Intended for use with Integrated Chinese 4E (Cheng & Tsui).

REQUIRES JDK 23 OR LATER

I started this program during my MCHI200 class at Concordia University because I was tired of lugging around my flash cards.

I finished it after graduation and still use it to this day.
